title: "Productivity vs. Management: What Matters in the Export Process?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/productivity
excerpt: In this paper, both a theoretical and an empirical model to study the contribution
of productivity and management practices on exporter status are
presented. On the theoretical side, a multiple heterogeneity model is developed,
where firms can differ in their levels of two different kinds of productivity:
in cost and in management, in a context of monopolistic competition.
With this, in the autarkic case, the model achieves two conditions (Zero Cut-
Off Profit Condition and Free Entry Condition) that firstly determine which
firms enter and produce in the market. Then, by opening the economy to
the rest of the world, the model not only shows which firms survive in the
domestic market but also which ones export. Therefore, the most productive
firms would not necessarily export, because export decision also depends on
how effectively firms carry out a set of management practices to adapt their
product to foreign demand.
